S2PLOT Interactive VOLumetric Visualisation Environment

This project aims at supporting interactive volumetric visualisation of 
three-dimensional data cubes.  The primary target is spectral data cubes. 
The use of S2PLOT supports multi-panel visualisation within a CAVE2 environment
and straight-forward support for generating interactive 3D-PDF publications via
LaTeX.
