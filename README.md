S2PLOT INteractive VOLumetric Visualisation Environment

The primary purpose of this package is to support interactive volumeteric visualisation of spectral data cubes as used in optical/infrared and radio astronomy.

The S2PLOT programming library enables simple access to powerful visualisation techniques, along with a straightforward open-source method for generating and publishing interactive 3D-PDF documents via LaTeX.
